If first attempts aren't perfect:

1. **Too Complex?**
   ```
   "Simplify the design, use fewer elements, more minimalist"
   ```

2. **Wrong Colors?**
   ```
   "Use purple #5B47ED as primary color and pink #FF6B9D as accent"
   ```

3. **Not Professional Enough?**
   ```
   "Make it more corporate and professional, less playful"
   ```

   ```
   "Make it friendlier and more approachable, add warmth"
   ```
