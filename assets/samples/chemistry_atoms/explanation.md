Here is a step-by-step visual guide on how Sodium and Chlorine form Sodium Chloride (table salt).

### 1. The Initial Atoms

First, let's look at the individual, neutral atoms. Sodium (Na) has one electron in its outer shell that it is eager to lose to become stable. Chlorine (Cl) has seven electrons in its outer shell and needs one more to complete it.

### 2. The Electron Transfer

When these two atoms come into contact, the Sodium atom transfers its single outer electron to the Chlorine atom. This is the key step in forming an ionic bond.

### 3. The Final Ionic Bond

After the transfer, Sodium has lost an electron and becomes a positively charged ion (Na+). Chlorine has gained an electron and becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl-). These opposite charges attract each other, forming a strong ionic bond and creating the compound Sodium Chloride (NaCl).
