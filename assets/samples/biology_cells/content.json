    "originalText": "Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms. Eukaryotic cells, found in plants and animals, contain membrane-bound organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. The nucleus houses genetic material in the form of DNA, which directs cellular activities. Mitochondria serve as the powerhouse of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. The endoplasmic reticulum facilitates protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, while the Golgi apparatus modifies and packages proteins for transport.",
