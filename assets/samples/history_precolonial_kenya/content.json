    "originalText": "Pre-colonial Kenya was inhabited by diverse communities organized into three main linguistic groups: the Bantu, Nilotes, and Cushites. These communities had well-established social structures, economic systems based on agriculture, pastoralism, and trade, and political organizations ranging from decentralized age-set systems to centralized monarchies. Long-distance trade networks connected the interior with the East African coast, facilitating exchange of goods including ivory, iron tools, and agricultural products.",
