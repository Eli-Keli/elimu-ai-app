    "originalText": "A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, expressed in the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. These equations can be solved using various methods including factoring, completing the square, or applying the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a. The discriminant, b²-4ac, determines the nature of the roots: positive yields two real solutions, zero yields one real solution, and negative yields two complex solutions.",
