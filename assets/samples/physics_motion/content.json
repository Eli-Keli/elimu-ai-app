    "originalText": "Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between an object and the forces acting upon it. The First Law (Inertia) states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The Second Law establishes that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). The Third Law posits that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These principles form the foundation of classical mechanics.",
    "simplifiedText": "**Sheria za Newton za Mwendo (Newton's Laws of Motion)**\n\nSir Isaac Newton discovered three important rules about how things move.\n\n---\n\n**LAW 1: The Law of Inertia (Sheria ya Utulivu)** 🛋️\n\n**\"Things keep doing what they're doing unless something stops them.\"**\n\n**Formal Statement:**\nAn object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n**Examples in Kenya:**\n\n🚌 **Matatu braking suddenly:**\n- Matatu stops, but passengers keep moving forward\n- That's why we need seatbelts!\n- Your body wants to keep moving (inertia)\n\n⚽ **Football on the pitch:**\n- A ball sits still until someone kicks it\n- A rolling ball keeps rolling until friction stops it\n\n🪨 **Pushing a rock:**\n- A heavy rock stays still until you push hard enough\n- Once moving, it wants to keep moving\n\n---\n\n**LAW 2: Force = Mass × Acceleration** 📐\n\n**F = ma**\n\n**\"Heavier things need more force to move.\"**\n\n**Where:**\n- **F** = Force (measured in Newtons, N)\n- **m** = Mass (measured in kilograms, kg)\n- **a** = Acceleration (measured in m/s²)\n\n**What it means:**\n- More force → faster acceleration\n- More mass → needs more force\n- Less mass → easier to move\n\n**Examples in Kenya:**\n\n🚲 **Bicycle vs Car:**\n- Easy to push a bicycle (small mass)\n- Hard to push a car (large mass)\n- Same force, different acceleration!\n\n🏋️ **Carrying luggage:**\n- Light bag: Easy to lift (small m, small F needed)\n- Heavy suitcase: Hard to lift (large m, large F needed)\n\n🚜 **Tractor pulling:**\n- Empty trailer: Moves fast (less mass)\n- Full trailer: Moves slow (more mass)\n- Same engine force!\n\n**Practice Calculations:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nA 50kg student on a boda boda.\nThe boda accelerates at 2 m/s².\nFind the force.\n\n**Solution:**\nF = ma\nF = 50 kg × 2 m/s²\nF = 100 N (Newtons)\n\n**Example 2:**\nA matatu (mass 2000kg) accelerates at 1.5 m/s².\nFind the force from the engine.\n\n**Solution:**\nF = ma\nF = 2000 kg × 1.5 m/s²\nF = 3000 N\n\n---\n\n**LAW 3: Action-Reaction (Kitendo na Mwitikio)** ⚖️\n\n**\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"**\n\n**Formal Statement:**\nWhen one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first object.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Forces come in PAIRS\n- Same size (magnitude)\n- Opposite direction\n- Act on DIFFERENT objects\n\n**Examples in Kenya:**\n\n🚶 **Walking:**\n- Your foot pushes BACKWARD on the ground (action)\n- Ground pushes FORWARD on you (reaction)\n- That's how you move forward!\n\n🏊 **Swimming in Lake Victoria:**\n- You push water BACKWARD (action)\n- Water pushes you FORWARD (reaction)\n\n🚀 **Rocket (or fireworks):**\n- Rocket pushes gas DOWNWARD (action)\n- Gas pushes rocket UPWARD (reaction)\n\n🛶 **Rowing a boat on Lake Nakuru:**\n- Oar pushes water BACKWARD (action)\n- Water pushes boat FORWARD (reaction)\n\n🤜 **Pushing a wall:**\n- You push wall → Wall pushes you back\n- If wall is stronger, you move backward!\n\n⚽ **Kicking a ball:**\n- Your foot pushes ball forward (action)\n- Ball pushes your foot backward (reaction)\n- Ball flies away, your foot feels the push!\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Law | Name | Key Idea | Formula |\n|-----|------|----------|--------|\n| 1st | Inertia | Things resist change | None |\n| 2nd | F=ma | Force causes acceleration | F = ma |\n| 3rd | Action-Reaction | Forces come in pairs | None |\n\n**Real-Life Applications:**\n\n🚗 **Vehicle Safety:**\n- Seatbelts (Law 1): Stop your inertia\n- Airbags (Law 2): Reduce force on you\n- Crumple zones (Law 2): Increase time, decrease force\n\n✈️ **Airplanes:**\n- Engines push air backward (Law 3)\n- Air pushes plane forward\n\n🎯 **Sports:**\n- Throwing javelin (Law 2): More force → farther throw\n- Running (Law 3): Push ground → you move forward",

        "Law 1 (Inertia): Objects resist changes in motion - explains seatbelts",
        "Law 2 (F=ma): Force causes acceleration - heavier things need more force",
        "Law 3 (Action-Reaction): Forces come in equal and opposite pairs",
        "These laws explain everything from walking to rockets",
        "Understanding these keeps you safe in matatus and vehicles"
