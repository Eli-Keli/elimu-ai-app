    "originalText": "East Africa comprises diverse physical features including the Great Rift Valley, major mountains such as Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya, extensive plateaus, large freshwater lakes including Lake Victoria, and a coastline along the Indian Ocean. These features result from various geological processes including faulting, volcanism, and erosion, and significantly influence climate, vegetation, settlement patterns, and economic activities in the region.",
    "simplifiedText": "**Vipengele vya Kimwili vya Afrika Mashariki**\n\n🌍 East Africa has amazing physical features that make our region unique!\n\n---\n\n## **1. The Great Rift Valley (Bonde Kuu la Ufa)** 🏔️\n\n**What is it?**\nA huge crack/valley running through East Africa from Ethiopia to Mozambique.\n\n**In Kenya:**\n- Runs from Lake Turkana (North) to Lake Magadi (South)\n- Visible from Nairobi-Nakuru highway\n- Width: 30-100 km\n- Depth: 450-600 meters\n\n**How it formed:**\n1. Tectonic forces (earth's crust moving)\n2. Land sank between two faults\n3. Created steep escarpments (cliffs)\n4. Still forming today!\n\n**Features inside the Rift:**\n- 🌊 **Lakes:** Turkana, Baringo, Bogoria, Nakuru, Naivasha, Magadi\n- 🌋 **Volcanoes:** Longonot, Suswa, Menengai\n- ♨️ **Hot springs & geysers:** Bogoria, Olkaria (geothermal power!)\n\n**Importance:**\n- ⚡ Geothermal energy (Olkaria Power Station)\n- 🦩 Tourism (flamingos at Lake Nakuru)\n- 🧂 Soda ash mining (Lake Magadi)\n- 🌾 Fertile volcanic soils for farming\n\n---\n\n## **2.
