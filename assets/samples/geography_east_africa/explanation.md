Here is a step-by-step diagram illustrating the formation of a rift valley and its lakes.

### 1. Normal Crust Level

Before any geological activity, the Earth's crust is a continuous, solid block.

### 2. Faults Form

Tensional forces (pulling apart) in the Earth's crust cause it to crack, creating parallel faults.

### 3. Land Between Faults Sinks

The central block of land between the faults sinks down as the outer blocks are pulled apart. This creates a valley, and the exposed sides of the outer blocks become steep cliffs called escarpments.

### 4. Lakes Form in Depression

Over time, the depression (the rift valley) fills with water from rain, rivers, or groundwater, forming lakes.

**Summary:** The formation of a rift valley and its lakes is a multi-step process. It begins with tensional forces pulling the Earth's crust apart, creating faults. The land between these faults then sinks, forming a valley with steep escarpments on either side. Finally, this valley can fill with water to create a lake, as seen in the final diagram.
